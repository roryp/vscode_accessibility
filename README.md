Accessibility Issues and Solutions in the LiveStream Repo
This repository contains code for a live streaming service, but like any web application, it has the potential to encounter accessibility issues. In this README, we will outline some common accessibility issues that can occur and suggest solutions for them.

Issue #1: Lack of Alternative Text for Images
One of the most common accessibility issues is the lack of alternative text (alt text) for images. Alt text is important because it allows users who cannot see images (e.g., because they are blind or have low vision) to understand the content of the image. If alt text is not provided, these users will be left with no information about the image.

Solution: Always provide descriptive alt text for all images on the website. The alt text should convey the purpose of the image, such as its content, function, or context. For example, instead of using alt text like "image123.jpg," use descriptive alt text like "A screenshot of the LiveStream homepage, showing upcoming live events."

Issue #2: Lack of Keyboard Accessibility
Another common accessibility issue is the lack of keyboard accessibility. Many users with disabilities rely on keyboard navigation to navigate a website, and if a website is not properly designed for keyboard accessibility, these users may not be able to use it effectively.

Solution: Ensure that all interactive elements on the website can be accessed and used with a keyboard. This includes making sure that users can navigate through the website using the Tab key, and that they can activate interactive elements (such as buttons) using the Enter or Space keys.

Issue #3: Poor Color Contrast
Color contrast is important for users with low vision or color blindness. If text or other content on the website has poor color contrast, these users may not be able to read or understand the content.

Solution: Ensure that all text and other content on the website has sufficient color contrast. This can be achieved by using a color contrast checker tool to check the contrast ratio between the text and its background. The contrast ratio should be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.

Issue #4: Inaccessible Video and Audio Content
Video and audio content can pose accessibility challenges for users who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as those who cannot access the content through their assistive technology.

Solution: Provide captions or transcripts for all video and audio content on the website. Captions provide a text-based version of the audio content, while transcripts provide a written version of the entire content. Both captions and transcripts make the content accessible to users who are deaf or hard of hearing, and they also make it easier for users to search and navigate the content.

Conclusion
By addressing these common accessibility issues, we can make the LiveStream website more accessible to a wider range of users. Accessibility is an important aspect of web development, and by prioritizing it, we can ensure that everyone has equal access to our content and services.
