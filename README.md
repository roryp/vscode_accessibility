## Introduction

Web accessibility refers to the design and development of websites that can be accessed and used by everyone, including those with disabilities. HTML is the markup language used to create web pages, and it plays a crucial role in making web content accessible.

However, many web developers are unaware of the accessibility issues that can arise when using HTML, and they may not know how to address these issues. This repository aims to raise awareness of these issues and provide solutions for addressing them.

## Common Accessibility Issues

Some common HTML accessibility issues include:

-   **Missing or inappropriate alt text for images:** Alt text provides a text alternative for images, which is important for users who cannot see them, such as those who are blind or have low vision. If alt text is missing or inappropriate, these users will not be able to understand the content of the image.
    
-   **Improper use of headings:** Headings provide a structure for the content of a web page, and they are important for users who rely on assistive technologies to navigate web pages. If headings are not used properly, these users may not be able to understand the hierarchy and structure of the content.
    
-   **Poor color contrast:** Color contrast is important for users with low vision or color blindness. If text or other content on a web page has poor color contrast, these users may not be able to read or understand the content.
    
-   **Inaccessible forms:** Forms are a common way for users to interact with web content, but they can pose accessibility challenges for users with disabilities. If forms are not properly designed for accessibility, these users may not be able to use them effectively.
    

## Solutions

To address these common HTML accessibility issues, consider the following solutions:

-   **Provide appropriate alt text for images:** Always provide descriptive alt text for all images on a web page. The alt text should convey the purpose of the image, such as its content, function, or context. For example, instead of using alt text like "image123.jpg," use descriptive alt text like "A screenshot of the LiveStream homepage, showing upcoming live events."
    
-   **Use headings properly:** Use headings to provide a logical structure for the content on a web page. Use heading levels in the correct order (e.g., H1 for the main heading, H2 for subheadings, etc.) and make sure that headings accurately reflect the content that follows.
    
-   **Ensure sufficient color contrast:** Make sure that all text and other content on a web page has sufficient color contrast. This can be achieved by using a color contrast checker tool to check the contrast ratio between the text and its background. The contrast ratio should be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.
    
-   **Design accessible forms:** Ensure that all interactive elements on a web page can be accessed and used with a keyboard. This includes making sure that users can navigate through the web page using the Tab key, and that they can activate interactive elements (such as buttons) using the Enter or Space keys. Use appropriate labels and instructions for form elements to ensure that users can understand their purpose.
